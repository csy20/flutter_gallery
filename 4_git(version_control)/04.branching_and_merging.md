# Branching & Merging

This is where Git's true power for safe development and collaboration shines. Branching allows you to work on features, experiments, and fixes without affecting the main codebase.

## 4.1. Why Use Branches?

Branches are one of Git's most powerful features, enabling parallel development and safe experimentation. Think of branches as alternate timelines for your project.

### The Problems Branches Solve

#### Without Branches (The Old Way)
```
Single Timeline Problems:
├── Working on Feature A
├── Bug discovered in production
├── Need to fix bug immediately
├── Feature A is half-finished and broken
├── Can't deploy the fix!
└── 😰 Everything is blocked
```

#### With Branches (The Git Way)
```
Multiple Timeline Solution:
main:     A---B---C---F---G    (always deployable)
           \         /
feature:    D---E---/          (isolated development)
             \
hotfix:       H---I            (emergency fixes)
```

### Key Benefits of Branching

#### 1. **Keep Main Branch Clean and Deployable**
```bash
# Main branch stays stable
main branch:  ✅ Always working
              ✅ Always deployable  
              ✅ Ready for releases
              ✅ Safe for hotfixes

# Development happens elsewhere
feature branches: 🚧 Work in progress
                  🔬 Experiments
                  🐛 Bug fixes
                  ✨ New features
```

#### 2. **Parallel Development**
```bash
# Multiple developers working simultaneously
Developer A: main → feature/user-auth
Developer B: main → feature/dashboard  
Developer C: main → bugfix/login-error
Developer D: main → hotfix/security-patch

# No conflicts, no stepping on each other's work!
```

#### 3. **Risk-Free Experimentation**
```bash
# Try new approaches without fear
git checkout -b experiment/new-architecture
# ... make radical changes ...
# If it works: merge back
# If it fails: delete branch, no harm done
```

#### 4. **Feature Isolation**
```bash
# Each feature develops independently
Feature A: 50% complete, not ready
Feature B: 90% complete, testing needed  
Feature C: 100% complete, ready to ship

# Ship Feature C without waiting for A or B
```

### Common Branch Types

#### **Main/Master Branch**
- 🎯 **Purpose**: Production-ready code
- 📋 **Rules**: Always stable, always deployable
- 🔒 **Protection**: Often protected from direct pushes

#### **Development Branch**
- 🎯 **Purpose**: Integration of completed features
- 📋 **Rules**: More stable than feature branches
- 🔄 **Flow**: Features merge here first, then to main

#### **Feature Branches**
- 🎯 **Purpose**: Individual feature development
- 📋 **Naming**: `feature/feature-name` or `feat/feature-name`
- 🔄 **Lifespan**: Created from main, merged back when complete

#### **Bugfix Branches**
- 🎯 **Purpose**: Non-critical bug fixes
- 📋 **Naming**: `bugfix/bug-description` or `fix/bug-description`
- 🔄 **Flow**: Similar to feature branches

#### **Hotfix Branches**
- 🎯 **Purpose**: Critical production fixes
- 📋 **Naming**: `hotfix/critical-fix`
- 🔄 **Flow**: Branch from main, merge to both main and develop

#### **Release Branches**
- 🎯 **Purpose**: Preparing releases
- 📋 **Naming**: `release/v1.2.0`
- 🔄 **Flow**: Final testing and minor fixes before release

## 4.2. Branching Operations

Let's learn the essential commands for working with branches effectively.

### Viewing Branches

```bash
# List all local branches
git branch

# Example output:
#   feature/user-auth
# * main                    # * indicates current branch
#   bugfix/login-error

# List all branches (local and remote)
git branch -a

# Example output:
#   feature/user-auth
# * main
#   remotes/origin/main
#   remotes/origin/develop
#   remotes/origin/feature/dashboard

# List remote branches only
git branch -r

# Show last commit for each branch
git branch -v

# Example output:
#   feature/user-auth  a1b2c3d Add password validation
# * main              e4f5g6h Update documentation  
#   bugfix/login      h7i8j9k Fix login redirect
```

### Creating Branches

#### Method 1: Create and Stay on Current Branch
```bash
# Create new branch from current location
git branch feature/user-profile

# Verify branch was created
git branch
# Output:
#   feature/user-profile
# * main                    # Still on main

# Create branch from specific commit
git branch bugfix/old-issue a1b2c3d

# Create branch from another branch
git branch feature/advanced-auth feature/user-auth
```

#### Method 2: Create and Switch Immediately
```bash
# Create and switch in one command (traditional)
git checkout -b feature/shopping-cart

# Create and switch in one command (modern)
git switch -c feature/shopping-cart

# Expected output:
# Switched to a new branch 'feature/shopping-cart'

# Verify you're on the new branch
git branch
# Output:
# * feature/shopping-cart   # * shows current branch
#   main
```

#### Method 3: Create from Remote Branch
```bash
# Create local branch tracking remote branch
git checkout -b feature/dashboard origin/feature/dashboard

# Simplified syntax (Git 2.23+)
git switch feature/dashboard  # Automatically tracks origin/feature/dashboard

# Create local branch with different name
git checkout -b local-dashboard origin/feature/dashboard
```

### Switching Between Branches

#### Using `git checkout` (Traditional)
```bash
# Switch to existing branch
git checkout main
git checkout feature/user-auth

# Switch with uncommitted changes (if safe)
git checkout feature/dashboard

# Force switch (discards uncommitted changes - DANGEROUS!)
git checkout --force feature/dashboard
```

#### Using `git switch` (Modern - Git 2.23+)
```bash
# Switch to existing branch
git switch main
git switch feature/user-auth

# Switch and create new branch
git switch -c feature/new-feature

# Switch with uncommitted changes
git switch feature/dashboard

# Restore previous branch
git switch -  # Like 'cd -' in bash
```

### Branch Naming Conventions

#### Standard Naming Patterns
```bash
# Feature branches
git checkout -b feature/user-authentication
git checkout -b feat/shopping-cart
git checkout -b feature/JIRA-123-payment-gateway

# Bug fixes
git checkout -b bugfix/fix-login-validation
git checkout -b fix/header-alignment
git checkout -b bugfix/ISSUE-456-memory-leak

# Hotfixes
git checkout -b hotfix/security-vulnerability
git checkout -b hotfix/v1.2.1-critical-patch

# Documentation
git checkout -b docs/api-documentation
git checkout -b docs/update-readme

# Refactoring
git checkout -b refactor/database-layer
git checkout -b refactor/simplify-auth-logic

# Experimental
git checkout -b experiment/new-ui-framework
git checkout -b spike/performance-optimization
```

#### Team Naming Conventions
```bash
# Include developer name
git checkout -b john/feature/user-profile
git checkout -b jane/bugfix/payment-error

# Include ticket numbers
git checkout -b feature/PROJ-123-user-dashboard
git checkout -b bugfix/BUG-456-login-issue

# Include dates for releases
git checkout -b release/2024-01-15
git checkout -b hotfix/2024-01-08-security
```

### Deleting Branches

#### Safe Deletion (Merged Only)
```bash
# Delete branch (only if merged)
git branch -d feature/completed-feature

# Example output if merged:
# Deleted branch feature/completed-feature (was a1b2c3d).

# Example output if not merged:
# error: The branch 'feature/incomplete' is not fully merged.
# If you are sure you want to delete it, run 'git branch -D feature/incomplete'.
```

#### Force Deletion (Unmerged)
```bash
# Force delete branch (even if not merged)
git branch -D feature/experimental-feature

# Delete remote branch
git push origin --delete feature/old-feature

# Delete remote tracking reference
git branch -dr origin/feature/old-feature
```

#### Cleaning Up Branches
```bash
# List branches that are merged into main
git branch --merged main

# Delete all merged branches (be careful!)
git branch --merged main | grep -v "main" | xargs git branch -d

# List branches not merged into main
git branch --no-merged main

# Prune remote tracking branches that no longer exist
git remote prune origin
```

## 4.3. Merging Branches

Merging combines the changes from one branch into another. Git offers different merge strategies depending on the branch history.

### Basic Merge Operation

```bash
# Basic merge workflow
# 1. Switch to target branch (usually main)
git checkout main

# 2. Pull latest changes (if working with remotes)
git pull origin main

# 3. Merge feature branch
git merge feature/user-authentication

# 4. Push merged changes
git push origin main
```

### Types of Merges

#### 1. Fast-Forward Merge

This happens when the target branch hasn't changed since the feature branch was created.

```bash
# Scenario: Linear history
main:     A---B---C
               \
feature:        D---E

# After fast-forward merge:
main:     A---B---C---D---E
```

**Example:**
```bash
# Start from main
git checkout main
# main is at commit C

# Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/simple-fix
# Make commits D and E
git commit -m "Fix simple bug" # D
git commit -m "Add tests" # E

# Switch back to main (still at C)
git checkout main

# Fast-forward merge
git merge feature/simple-fix
# Output: Fast-forward
#         a1b2c3d..e4f5g6h  main -> main

# History is now linear: A-B-C-D-E
```

#### 2. Three-Way Merge (True Merge)

This happens when both branches have new commits.

```bash
# Scenario: Divergent history
main:     A---B---C---F---G
               \         /
feature:        D---E---/

# After three-way merge:
main:     A---B---C---F---G---M
               \             /
feature:        D---E-------/
# M is a merge commit
```

**Example:**
```bash
# Start from main at commit C
git checkout -b feature/new-feature
# Make commits D and E on feature branch

# Meanwhile, main got commits F and G
# When merging:
git checkout main
git merge feature/new-feature

# Output: Merge made by the 'recursive' strategy.
#         [additional files changed details]

# Creates merge commit M with two parents: G and E
```

#### 3. Squash Merge

Combines all feature branch commits into a single commit.

```bash
# Scenario: Multiple commits on feature branch
feature:  D---E---F---G (4 commits)

# After squash merge:
main:     A---B---C---S (S contains all changes from D,E,F,G)
```

**Example:**
```bash
# Squash merge (doesn't create merge commit)
git checkout main
git merge --squash feature/multiple-commits

# This stages all changes but doesn't commit
git status
# Output: All modifications staged

# Create single commit
git commit -m "Add complete user authentication feature

- Implement login system
- Add password validation  
- Create user registration
- Add authentication tests"

# Clean up feature branch
git branch -d feature/multiple-commits
```

### Merge Options and Flags

#### No Fast-Forward Merge
```bash
# Always create merge commit (even for fast-forward)
git merge --no-ff feature/important-feature

# Why use --no-ff?
# - Preserves feature branch history
# - Makes it clear when features were integrated
# - Easier to revert entire features
```

#### Fast-Forward Only
```bash
# Only merge if fast-forward is possible
git merge --ff-only feature/simple-change

# If fast-forward isn't possible:
# fatal: Not possible to fast-forward, aborting.
```

#### Custom Merge Messages
```bash
# Provide custom merge commit message
git merge -m "Integrate user authentication system" feature/user-auth

# Edit merge message in editor
git merge --edit feature/user-auth
```

### Merge vs. Rebase

#### Merge: Preserves History
```bash
# Merge preserves the branching structure
main:     A---B---C---M
               \     /
feature:        D---E

# Pro: Complete history, easy to see when features were added
# Con: Can create complex graph with many merge commits
```

#### Rebase: Linear History  
```bash
# Rebase creates linear history
git checkout feature/user-auth
git rebase main
git checkout main
git merge feature/user-auth  # Fast-forward

# Result:
main:     A---B---C---D'---E'

# Pro: Clean, linear history
# Con: Rewrites commit history, loses branching context
```

## 4.4. Handling Merge Conflicts

Merge conflicts occur when Git can't automatically combine changes from different branches. This happens when the same lines of code are modified in both branches.

### When Conflicts Occur

#### Common Conflict Scenarios
```bash
# Scenario 1: Same line modified differently
# Branch A changes line 5: "Hello World"  
# Branch B changes line 5: "Hello Git"
# Conflict: Git doesn't know which to keep

# Scenario 2: File deleted in one branch, modified in another
# Branch A: Deletes file.txt
# Branch B: Modifies file.txt
# Conflict: Delete or keep the modified file?

# Scenario 3: Same file renamed differently
# Branch A: Renames file.txt to document.txt
# Branch B: Renames file.txt to readme.txt  
# Conflict: Which name to use?
```

### Recognizing Merge Conflicts

```bash
# When a merge conflict occurs
git merge feature/conflicting-branch

# Output:
# Auto-merging src/main.py
# CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in src/main.py
# Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.

# Check status during conflict
git status

# Output:
# On branch main
# You have unmerged paths.
#   (fix conflicts and run "git commit")
#   (use "git merge --abort" to abort the merge)
# 
# Unmerged paths:
#   (use "git add <file>..." to mark resolution)
#         both modified:   src/main.py
```

### Understanding Conflict Markers

When Git encounters a conflict, it adds special markers to the file:

```python
# Example conflicted file: src/main.py
def greet_user(name):
<<<<<<< HEAD
    print(f"Hello {name}, welcome to our app!")
    return f"Welcome {name}"
=======
    print(f"Hi {name}, glad you're here!")
    return f"Greetings {name}"
>>>>>>> feature/new-greeting
```

**Conflict Marker Explanation:**
- `<<<<<<< HEAD`: Start of current branch changes (main)
- `=======`: Separator between conflicting versions
- `>>>>>>> feature/new-greeting`: End of merging branch changes
- Everything between markers shows the conflicting content

### Resolving Conflicts Manually

#### Step 1: Open Conflicted Files
```bash
# Find conflicted files
git status

# Open in your editor
code src/main.py  # VS Code
vim src/main.py   # Vim
nano src/main.py  # Nano
```

#### Step 2: Choose Resolution Strategy

**Strategy 1: Keep Current Branch (HEAD)**
```python
# Remove conflict markers and keep HEAD version
def greet_user(name):
    print(f"Hello {name}, welcome to our app!")
    return f"Welcome {name}"
```

**Strategy 2: Keep Incoming Branch**
```python  
# Remove conflict markers and keep incoming version
def greet_user(name):
    print(f"Hi {name}, glad you're here!")
    return f"Greetings {name}"
```

**Strategy 3: Combine Both Changes**
```python
# Merge both changes creatively
def greet_user(name):
    print(f"Hello {name}, welcome to our app!")
    print(f"We're glad you're here!")
    return f"Welcome {name}"
```

**Strategy 4: Write New Solution**
```python
# Create entirely new solution
def greet_user(name):
    greeting = f"Hello {name}! Welcome to our amazing app!"
    print(greeting)
    return greeting
```

#### Step 3: Mark as Resolved
```bash
# After editing the file, stage it
git add src/main.py

# Check that conflict is resolved
git status
# Output:
# On branch main
# All conflicts fixed but you are still merging.
#   (use "git commit" to conclude merge)
```

#### Step 4: Complete the Merge
```bash
# Commit the merge (opens editor for merge commit message)
git commit

# Or provide message directly
git commit -m "Merge feature/new-greeting

Resolved conflict in greet_user function by combining
both greeting approaches for better user experience."
```

### Using Visual Merge Tools

#### Configure Merge Tool
```bash
# Set up VS Code as merge tool
git config --global merge.tool vscode
git config --global mergetool.vscode.cmd 'code --wait $MERGED'

# Set up other popular tools
git config --global merge.tool kdiff3     # KDiff3
git config --global merge.tool meld       # Meld  
git config --global merge.tool vimdiff    # Vim diff
```

#### Launch Merge Tool
```bash
# Start visual merge tool for conflicts
git mergetool

# This opens your configured tool with three panels:
# - Left: Current branch (HEAD)
# - Center: Result (edit here)  
# - Right: Incoming branch

# After resolving in tool, stage the file
git add resolved-file.py
```

### Advanced Conflict Resolution

#### Aborting a Merge
```bash
# If conflicts are too complex, abort the merge
git merge --abort

# This returns you to the state before merge attempt
# Your working directory is restored
# No merge commit is created
```

#### Using Git's Automatic Resolution
```bash
# Automatically resolve conflicts favoring one side
git merge -X ours feature/branch      # Favor current branch
git merge -X theirs feature/branch    # Favor incoming branch

# Note: This only works for conflicts, not all changes
```

#### Cherry-pick Specific Changes
```bash
# Instead of merging entire branch, pick specific commits
git cherry-pick a1b2c3d  # Apply single commit
git cherry-pick a1b2c3d..e4f5g6h  # Apply range of commits
```

### Preventing Conflicts

#### 1. **Frequent Integration**
```bash
# Regularly update feature branches from main
git checkout feature/my-branch
git pull origin main
# or
git rebase origin/main
```

#### 2. **Small, Focused Branches**
```bash
# Create small branches that change fewer files
git checkout -b feature/fix-single-bug
# Better than large branches touching many files
```

#### 3. **Communication**
```bash
# Coordinate with team on file ownership
# Use code review to catch potential conflicts early
# Establish coding standards to reduce style conflicts
```

#### 4. **File Organization**
```bash
# Structure code to minimize overlapping changes
# Use dependency injection to reduce coupling
# Separate concerns into different files
```

### Complex Conflict Example

Let's walk through a realistic conflict resolution:

```bash
# Setup: Two developers working on same feature
# Developer A: Adds error handling
# Developer B: Adds logging

# File before changes (main branch):
def process_data(data):
    result = transform(data)
    return result

# Developer A's changes (feature/error-handling):
def process_data(data):
    try:
        result = transform(data)
        return result
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error processing data: {e}")
        return None

# Developer B's changes (feature/logging):
def process_data(data):
    print(f"Processing data: {data}")
    result = transform(data)
    print(f"Transform completed: {result}")
    return result

# Merge conflict when combining:
def process_data(data):
<<<<<<< HEAD
    try:
        result = transform(data)
        return result
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error processing data: {e}")
        return None
=======
    print(f"Processing data: {data}")
    result = transform(data)
    print(f"Transform completed: {result}")
    return result
>>>>>>> feature/logging

# Resolved version (combines both features):
def process_data(data):
    print(f"Processing data: {data}")
    try:
        result = transform(data)
        print(f"Transform completed: {result}")
        return result
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error processing data: {e}")
        return None
```

## Best Practices for Branching and Merging

### 1. **Branch Strategy**
```bash
# Use consistent naming conventions
feature/TICKET-123-user-auth
bugfix/fix-login-redirect  
hotfix/security-patch-v1.2.1

# Keep branches short-lived
# Merge or delete within 1-2 weeks
```

### 2. **Before Merging**
```bash
# Always test your branch
# Update from main branch first
git checkout feature/my-branch
git pull origin main

# Run tests
npm test  # or your test command

# Push and create pull request for review
```

### 3. **Merge Commit Messages**
```bash
# Use descriptive merge messages
git merge -m "Add user authentication system

Features added:
- Login/logout functionality  
- Password reset capability
- Session management
- Input validation

Resolves: #123, #124
Reviewed-by: @teammate" feature/user-auth
```

### 4. **Post-Merge Cleanup**
```bash
# Delete merged feature branches
git branch -d feature/completed-feature
git push origin --delete feature/completed-feature

# Update main branch
git checkout main
git pull origin main
```

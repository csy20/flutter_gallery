# Intermediate Git Techniques

Once you're comfortable with Git basics, these intermediate techniques will help you work more efficiently and maintain a clean project history. This guide covers essential tools for undoing changes, managing work-in-progress, cleaning up commits, and versioning your releases.

## 6.1. Undoing Things

Git provides several ways to undo changes, each suited for different scenarios. Understanding when to use each method is crucial for maintaining a clean repository.

### 6.1.1. Modifying the Last Commit (`git commit --amend`)

Use `--amend` when you need to modify the most recent commit that hasn't been pushed yet.

#### Common Use Cases:
- Fix typos in commit messages
- Add forgotten files to the last commit
- Update the content of the last commit

#### Basic Syntax:
```bash
# Modify commit message only
git commit --amend -m "New commit message"

# Add files to last commit and modify message
git add forgotten-file.txt
git commit --amend -m "Updated commit with forgotten file"

# Amend without changing the commit message
git commit --amend --no-edit
```

#### Example Workflow:
```bash
# You made a commit but forgot to add a file
git commit -m "Add user authentication"

# Realize you forgot to add a test file
git add test/auth_test.dart
git commit --amend -m "Add user authentication with tests"

# The original commit is replaced, not added to
```

#### ⚠️ Important Notes:
- **Never amend commits that have been pushed to shared repositories**
- Amending changes the commit hash, rewriting history
- Only amend commits that are still local to your machine

### 6.1.2. Unstaging and Reverting with `git reset`

`git reset` is a powerful command that can unstage files or move your branch pointer to different commits.

#### Types of Reset:

**1. Soft Reset (`--soft`)**
- Moves HEAD to specified commit
- Keeps changes in staging area
- Use when you want to recommit with different message/structure

```bash
# Undo last commit but keep changes staged
git reset --soft HEAD~1

# Undo last 3 commits, keeping all changes staged
git reset --soft HEAD~3
```

**2. Mixed Reset (`--mixed` - default)**
- Moves HEAD to specified commit
- Unstages changes but keeps them in working directory
- Most common type of reset

```bash
# Unstage all files (keep changes in working directory)
git reset HEAD

# Unstage specific file
git reset HEAD file.txt

# Undo last commit, unstage changes
git reset HEAD~1
```

**3. Hard Reset (`--hard`)**
- Moves HEAD to specified commit
- **Permanently deletes** unstaged changes
- Use with extreme caution

```bash
# DANGER: Permanently lose all uncommitted changes
git reset --hard HEAD

# DANGER: Go back 2 commits and lose all changes
git reset --hard HEAD~2
```

#### Reset Examples:
```bash
# Scenario: You want to unstage a file
git add file1.txt file2.txt
git reset HEAD file2.txt  # Only file1.txt remains staged

# Scenario: You want to split a large commit
git reset --soft HEAD~1   # Undo commit, keep changes staged
# Now you can make multiple smaller commits

# Scenario: You want to completely start over
git reset --hard HEAD     # Lose all uncommitted changes
```

### 6.1.3. Safe Undoing with `git revert`

`git revert` creates a new commit that undoes the changes from a previous commit. This is the safest way to undo changes in shared repositories.

#### Basic Usage:
```bash
# Revert the last commit
git revert HEAD

# Revert a specific commit by hash
git revert abc1234

# Revert multiple commits
git revert HEAD~3..HEAD

# Revert without creating a commit (stage the revert)
git revert --no-commit HEAD
```

#### Example Scenario:
```bash
# Your commit history
git log --oneline
abc1234 (HEAD) Add broken feature
def5678 Fix bug in login
ghi9012 Update documentation

# Revert the broken feature
git revert abc1234
# This creates a new commit that undoes abc1234

# New history
git log --oneline
xyz9999 (HEAD) Revert "Add broken feature"
abc1234 Add broken feature
def5678 Fix bug in login
ghi9012 Update documentation
```

#### Reset vs Revert Comparison:
| Command | History | Safety | Use Case |
|---------|---------|---------|----------|
| `git reset` | Rewrites | Destructive | Local changes only |
| `git revert` | Preserves | Safe | Shared repositories |

## 6.2. Stashing Changes

Git stash temporarily saves uncommitted changes, allowing you to switch branches or pull updates without committing incomplete work.

### 6.2.1. Basic Stashing Operations

```bash
# Save current changes to stash
git stash

# Save with a descriptive message
git stash push -m "Work in progress on user profile"

# List all stashes
git stash list

# Apply the most recent stash
git stash apply

# Apply and remove from stash list
git stash pop

# Apply a specific stash
git stash apply stash@{2}

# Delete a specific stash
git stash drop stash@{1}

# Delete all stashes
git stash clear
```

### 6.2.2. Advanced Stashing

```bash
# Stash only staged changes
git stash --staged

# Stash including untracked files
git stash -u

# Stash including ignored files
git stash -a

# Stash specific files
git stash push -m "Partial work" -- file1.txt file2.txt

# Create a branch from a stash
git stash branch new-feature-branch stash@{0}
```

### 6.2.3. Practical Stashing Workflows

**Workflow 1: Emergency Bug Fix**
```bash
# You're working on a feature when a critical bug is reported
git stash push -m "WIP: new user registration form"
git checkout main
git checkout -b hotfix/critical-bug
# Fix the bug, commit, and merge
git checkout feature-user-profiles
git stash pop  # Continue your work
```

**Workflow 2: Pull Updates**
```bash
# You have uncommitted changes but need to pull updates
git stash
git pull origin main
git stash pop

# If conflicts occur during pop
git stash pop
# Resolve conflicts manually
git add .
# The stash is automatically dropped after successful resolution
```

**Workflow 3: Experiment Safely**
```bash
# Stash current work to try a different approach
git stash push -m "Current approach to user auth"
# Try new approach
# If new approach works better:
git stash drop  # Remove old approach
# If old approach was better:
git stash pop   # Restore old approach
```

## 6.3. Interactive Rebase (`git rebase -i`)

Interactive rebase allows you to clean up your commit history before sharing it with others. This is essential for maintaining a readable project history.

### 6.3.1. Starting an Interactive Rebase

```bash
# Rebase the last 3 commits
git rebase -i HEAD~3

# Rebase since a specific commit
git rebase -i abc1234

# Rebase since branching from main
git rebase -i main
```

### 6.3.2. Interactive Rebase Commands

When you start an interactive rebase, Git opens an editor with available commands:

```bash
pick abc1234 Add user authentication
pick def5678 Fix authentication bug
pick ghi9012 Add user tests
pick jkl3456 Fix test typo

# Commands:
# p, pick = use commit
# r, reword = use commit, but edit the commit message
# e, edit = use commit, but stop for amending
# s, squash = use commit, but meld into previous commit
# f, fixup = like "squash", but discard this commit's log message
# x, exec = run command (the rest of the line) using shell
# d, drop = remove commit
```

### 6.3.3. Common Rebase Operations

**1. Squashing Commits**
```bash
# Before: Multiple small commits
pick abc1234 Add user model
squash def5678 Fix user model typo
squash ghi9012 Add user validation
pick jkl3456 Add user tests

# Result: Two clean commits
# "Add user model with validation"
# "Add user tests"
```

**2. Reordering Commits**
```bash
# Original order
pick abc1234 Add feature A
pick def5678 Add feature B
pick ghi9012 Fix feature A bug

# Reordered for logical flow
pick abc1234 Add feature A
pick ghi9012 Fix feature A bug
pick def5678 Add feature B
```

**3. Rewording Commit Messages**
```bash
# Change command to reword
reword abc1234 Add user authentication
pick def5678 Fix authentication bug

# Git will pause to let you edit the commit message
```

**4. Dropping Unwanted Commits**
```bash
pick abc1234 Add important feature
drop def5678 Add debug logging  # Remove this commit
pick ghi9012 Add feature tests
```

### 6.3.4. Example: Cleaning Up a Feature Branch

```bash
# Your messy commit history
git log --oneline
ghi9012 (HEAD) Oops, fix typo
def5678 Add more validation
abc1234 WIP: user registration
xyz7890 Start user registration
mno4567 (main) Last main commit

# Start interactive rebase
git rebase -i main

# In the editor, clean up:
pick xyz7890 Start user registration
squash abc1234 WIP: user registration
squash def5678 Add more validation
squash ghi9012 Oops, fix typo

# Result: One clean commit
# "Implement user registration with validation"
```

### 6.3.5. Handling Rebase Conflicts

```bash
# If conflicts occur during rebase
git status  # Shows conflicted files

# Fix conflicts in your editor, then:
git add conflicted-file.txt
git rebase --continue

# To abort the rebase and return to original state:
git rebase --abort

# To skip a problematic commit:
git rebase --skip
```

### 6.3.6. Best Practices for Interactive Rebase

1. **Only rebase local commits** - Never rebase commits that have been pushed to shared repositories
2. **Make atomic commits** - Each commit should represent one logical change
3. **Write clear commit messages** - After squashing, write descriptive messages
4. **Test after rebasing** - Ensure your code still works after history changes
5. **Keep it simple** - Don't try to do too much in one rebase session

## 6.4. Tagging

Tags are used to mark specific points in your repository's history, typically for releases or important milestones.

### 6.4.1. Types of Tags

**1. Lightweight Tags**
- Simple pointers to specific commits
- Just a name, no additional metadata

```bash
# Create a lightweight tag
git tag v1.0.0

# Tag a specific commit
git tag v1.0.0 abc1234

# List all tags
git tag
```

**2. Annotated Tags** (Recommended)
- Full objects with metadata (author, date, message)
- Can be signed with GPG
- Better for releases

```bash
# Create an annotated tag
git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "Release version 1.0.0"

# Tag with detailed message
git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "
Version 1.0.0 Release Notes:
- Added user authentication
- Improved performance
- Fixed critical security issues
"

# Tag a specific commit
git tag -a v1.0.0 abc1234 -m "Release version 1.0.0"
```

### 6.4.2. Working with Tags

```bash
# List all tags
git tag

# List tags with pattern
git tag -l "v1.*"

# Show tag information
git show v1.0.0

# Create tag and push to remote
git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "Release version 1.0.0"
git push origin v1.0.0

# Push all tags
git push origin --tags

# Delete a local tag
git tag -d v1.0.0

# Delete a remote tag
git push origin --delete tag v1.0.0
```

### 6.4.3. Semantic Versioning with Tags

Follow semantic versioning (SemVer) for consistent version numbering:

```bash
# Format: MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH
git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "Initial release"
git tag -a v1.0.1 -m "Bug fixes"
git tag -a v1.1.0 -m "New features, backward compatible"
git tag -a v2.0.0 -m "Breaking changes"

# Pre-release versions
git tag -a v2.0.0-alpha.1 -m "Alpha release"
git tag -a v2.0.0-beta.1 -m "Beta release"
git tag -a v2.0.0-rc.1 -m "Release candidate"
```

### 6.4.4. Release Workflow with Tags

```bash
# 1. Complete your release branch
git checkout release/v1.2.0
git merge feature/new-authentication

# 2. Update version files (package.json, etc.)
git add .
git commit -m "Bump version to 1.2.0"

# 3. Create release tag
git tag -a v1.2.0 -m "
Release v1.2.0
- Enhanced user authentication
- Performance improvements
- Bug fixes
"

# 4. Merge to main and push
git checkout main
git merge release/v1.2.0
git push origin main
git push origin v1.2.0

# 5. Deploy using the tag
git checkout v1.2.0
# Deploy to production
```

### 6.4.5. Checking Out Tags

```bash
# Checkout a specific tag (detached HEAD state)
git checkout v1.0.0

# Create a branch from a tag
git checkout -b hotfix/v1.0.1 v1.0.0

# Find which tag contains a commit
git tag --contains abc1234

# Find commits since last tag
git log v1.0.0..HEAD --oneline
```

## 6.5. Practical Workflows Combining These Techniques

### Workflow 1: Feature Development and Cleanup

```bash
# 1. Start feature work
git checkout -b feature/user-profiles
# Make several commits...

# 2. Stash work for urgent bug fix
git stash push -m "WIP: user profile editing"
git checkout main
git checkout -b hotfix/login-bug
# Fix and merge hotfix...

# 3. Return to feature work
git checkout feature/user-profiles
git stash pop

# 4. Clean up commit history before PR
git rebase -i main
# Squash, reorder, and reword commits

# 5. Final review and push
git push origin feature/user-profiles
```

### Workflow 2: Release Preparation

```bash
# 1. Create release branch
git checkout -b release/v1.1.0 develop

# 2. Make final adjustments
git commit -m "Update version numbers"
git commit -m "Update changelog"

# 3. Clean up any messy commits
git rebase -i develop

# 4. Create release tag
git tag -a v1.1.0 -m "Release version 1.1.0"

# 5. Merge to main and push
git checkout main
git merge release/v1.1.0
git push origin main --tags
```

### Workflow 3: Mistake Recovery

```bash
# Scenario: Accidentally committed sensitive data
git log --oneline
abc1234 (HEAD) Add API keys  # OOPS!
def5678 Add new feature
ghi9012 Fix bug

# Option 1: If not pushed yet, use reset
git reset --hard HEAD~1  # Remove the commit entirely

# Option 2: If already pushed, use revert
git revert abc1234  # Safer for shared repositories

# Option 3: If in a series of commits, use interactive rebase
git rebase -i HEAD~3
# Drop the problematic commit in the editor
```

## 6.6. Best Practices Summary

1. **Undoing Changes:**
   - Use `git revert` for shared repositories
   - Use `git reset` only for local changes
   - Always backup important work before destructive operations

2. **Stashing:**
   - Use descriptive messages for stashes
   - Don't let stashes accumulate - clean them regularly
   - Consider creating branches for long-term work instead of stashing

3. **Interactive Rebase:**
   - Only rebase local commits
   - Keep atomic commits (one logical change per commit)
   - Test your code after rebasing
   - Use meaningful commit messages after squashing

4. **Tagging:**
   - Use annotated tags for releases
   - Follow semantic versioning
   - Always push tags to remote repositories
   - Document release notes in tag messages

5. **General Guidelines:**
   - Always understand what a command does before running it
   - Keep backups of important work
   - Communicate with your team about history changes
   - Use these tools to maintain clean, readable project history

These intermediate techniques will significantly improve your Git workflow and help you maintain professional-quality version control practices. Practice these commands in a test repository before using them on important projects!
